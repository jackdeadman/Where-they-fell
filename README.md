# Where they fell

## A searchable index for those who served in WW1

Currently pulls in data from the [Sheffield Soldiers of the Great War](http://www.sheffieldsoldierww1.co.uk/) website, converting it to JSON format.

Has a mockup web interface, we hope to expand this to show links between battles.
